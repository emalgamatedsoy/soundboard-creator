This application is to provide an end-user a tool to create an html5 based soundboard.
How it works:

1.) browse for a file directory that has all of your sounds.
	-> version 1.0 uses only the immediate .ogg, .mp3 and .wav files in that directory.
2.) press the create button.

It's very simple to use.

This program is geared towards individuals that would like to create soundboards 
without having to assemble it together from scratch.

Each sound is a button that can be pressed.
Only one sound can be played at a time.
You can hit the button as many times as you'd like to re - re - re - restart the sound :)
